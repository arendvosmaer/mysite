# Arend!?
  Yes - Arend! A site full of stuff about Arend, with Arend, for Arend and/or by Arend, **and it's free!**
  	
<!--
  I can hear you thinking: wait, all of this for free? What's the catch? But don't worry!
  We'll stay free for ever! Until we introduce Arend! Premium (a.k.a. Golden Arend!). 
  
  Then, when our user base has grown to hundres of millions, we'll just sell out to Yahoo or 
  some other big E-corp who'll just use the customer data and pull the plug on the rest.

  Oh, and we'll post a blog about [Our Incredible Journey](http://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com/ "Our Incredible Journey").
  
  **Bless the web-based economy!**
